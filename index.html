    <h1>Matthew Bowler</h1>
    <p>In June of 2019 after a long career in mortgage and non-profit housing development, my wife and 8-year-old son decided to take a year off and travel the world for a year. I had previously started a small “Healthy Vending” company as “side gig” with several machines located in various schools in Jacksonville, Florida and together by renting our home on Airbnb, teaching English to Chinese children online, and a small amount of savings as a backup, we hoped to come close to breaking even financially each month and maybe even become able to fund our travels indefinitely. 
    
    While we were living in our first stop in Cuenca, Ecuador we came across many full-time travelers that “code” and work remotely. At their suggestion, I began to investigate a few languages like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS and found that the learning method was very similar to the language learning that I had been doing to prepare for our travels. I also loved the challenge and the process of coding, but soon found that I needed a bit more structure in order to really wrap my arms around the process. That is where UCF Coding Bootcamp came in. Now because “I didn’t know what I didn’t know”, I am finding that this has not been a process of a career change, but more of a career enhancement because with the changing mortgage and development environment, I can take my previous expertise and layer coding on top to secure employment in the future while allowing myself to work remotely and continue to travel. I love the work and look forward to exploring this new world of coding and our real “geographic” world in the process.
